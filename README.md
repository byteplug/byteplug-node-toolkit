# Byteplug Toolkit for Javascript

This is the official toolkit for the JavasScript programming language that
implements the Byteplug in-house standards.

It contains two separate code bases (kept in a single repository for
convenience) which are located in the `payload/` and `endpoints/` folders.

To generate the documentation.

```
npm install -g jsdoc
jsdoc -c jsdoc.json -u --readme README.md
```
